## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript

5 event listeners (one for each button) are used trigger 3 other functions which randomize the bot's weapon selection, check if the bot or user won, and display a message in the DOM informing the user of the results.

## Optimizations

I'd make it ES6 compliant instead of vanilla javascript.

## Lessons Learned:

Always check carefully for reassignment versus the equal operator.

## Examples:
Take a look at all of the rest of my github projects!
